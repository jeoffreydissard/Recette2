Symfony 3.4 Skeleton With FOSUserBundle
=========

### Simply here to save time when developing a site using Symfony 3.4 that requires users. ~~Simply here for lazy people, like myself.~~ ###

The project includes the basic **UserBundle** as required by FOSUserBundle and also includes an empty bundle called **HomeBundle**, which is ready to be used/deleted depending on your needs. 

**Symfony Version:** 3.4.*
**FOSUserBundle Version:** 2.0

FOSUserBundle has been setup for Doctrine ORM as instructed in the [FOSUserBundle guide](https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/FOSUserBundle/index.html)
